Dataset used can be in "UCI HAR Dataset"

ANN.py : Artifical Neural Network training script
KNN.py : K nearest neighbor training script
Random_Forest.py : Random forest training script
SVM.py : Support Vector Machine training script
XGBoost.py : extreme gradient boosting training script
Main.py : Compilation of all the script. Main training script
Preprocessing.ipynb : outlier removal, SMOTE and PCA script

Run instructions:
cmd line run :
1) python3 Main.py
2) select which dataset and model to train

'Preprocessed_training_set' folder contains the processed dataset

train_df.csv : raw train dataset
train_df_O.csv : train dataset with outliers removed using IQR
train_df_O_T.csv.arff : train dataset with outliers removed and transformed using weka
train_df_O_T_Smote.csv : train dataset with outliers removed, transformed using weka and SMOTE
train_df_O_T_Smote_PCA.csv : train dataset with outliers removed, transformed using weka, SMOTE and PCA processed

test_df.csv : raw test dataset
test_df_log_csv.arff : test dataset transformed using weka
test_df_log_PCA.csv : test dataset transformed using weka and PCA processed

Additional Notes:
when loading the datasets into weka for inbuilt classifier training, remember to convert the class label to nominal using numeric_to_nominal, to observe accuracy and confusion matrix. File saved using weka (.Arff) have class labels converted to nominal.
